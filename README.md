## BudgetBoi makes budgeting easier.
### Start by signing up.
Once you are signed up you can begin your budgeting journey!  
Remember, we store your budgeting information so the second time is much, much easier.

### First, head to the Your Incomes page.
There's no better place to start than the money that's coming in.  
  
Add your regular incomes to this page, including a name and an amount.  
If there was already money in the bank you would like to apply to this budget, add that in the 'Starting Amount' input.  
Any irregular or additional income can be added in the 'Other Income' field.

### Now that that's done, go to Your Bills.
Bills are the worst, but you have to pay them. That's why we take them out of our budget first.  
Then we can divy up the rest of our money to the fun & exciting things!  
  
The best way to do this is to add ALL of your monthly bills.  
Anything with a due date is a good thing to include here.  
  
When all your bills are added, it's easy to simply check off the bills you have to pay this budget period and ignore the rest!

### Last up is the Your Spending page.
Your Spending is made up of different categories.  
Pretty much everything else goes on this page that we haven't already covered.  
Things like groceries, personal care supplies, dog food, entertainment money, you name it!  
  
You may need to adjust how much is in each category several times until you get it down, but don't worry, the hard work pays off.  
Once your Spending is set up the way you prefer, it is stored so every time after that is simply a review of the selections you already made.  
Of course, you can still adjust anything you would like.

### Now comes the best part, Your Budget!
Your Budget gives you a breakdown of everything you just did.  
It shows you Your Incomes, Bills, and Spending categories, as well as your margin for this budget period and how much cash to withdraw from the bank 
(that is, if you chose to check any of the checkboxes on the Your Spending page).
  


#### Thank you for using BudgetBoi!
I hope you are able to save tons of money.
